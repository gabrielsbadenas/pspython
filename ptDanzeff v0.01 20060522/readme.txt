ptDanzeff is an adaptation of Danzeff OSK and Newkey for PSP's Luaplayer and 
Python-PSP which can be found at http://localhost.geek.nz while ptDanzeff OSK
and Newkey for Luaplayer and Python-PSP can be found at http://www.palmtime.com 

ptDanzeff LuaOSK, LuaNewkey, PyOSK, PyNewkey were not meant to be state-of-
the-art Lua and Python scripts but to closely follow the Danzeff OSK C source.

See Cancan's adaptation for another POV on Danzeff OSK under Lua.

This is my first try at Lua and Python. By wanting to keep the source code as
closely as possible to the original source, I have decided not to change the 
spirit of the original C sources and kept roughly the same global variables and 
functions. I daily work in Smalltalk, so I may eventually OO, MVC and pattern 
everything. But then again, with two young kids at home, I may keep everything
as is and implement new features or start another project.

I would like to thank everybody on the PSP homebrew scene, this is my small
part to the community. Kudos goes to oobles, oopo, fanjita, ditlew, shine, 
nevyn, fraca7 without whome homebrew would not be possible on the PSP and to
danzell and jeff for providing us an excellent OSK and input system. Kudos to 
cancan who worked on his own adaptation for lua at probably the same time but
was able to release it a few days earlier. Finally, ps2dev.org, luaplayer.org,
